the university of chicago was founded by a small group of baptist educators through a land endowment by senator stephen a. douglas. disparagingly called douglas college by its detractors, the university of chicago's original ten-acre campus was on the northwest corner of thirty-fifth street and cottage grove avenue, a neighborhood now known as bronzeville. local baptist congregations secured donations to help partially finance construction of the elaborate gothic-style building, named douglas hall, with loans collateralized against the douglas land used to secure the balance.
