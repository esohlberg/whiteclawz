i've been keeping track of which countries most of my cell-phone calls come from, and the united states of america is way behind. slovenia is in the lead, but lately the lithuanians have been giving the slovenians a run for their money—or, considering the warnings that we’re constantly getting about the danger of answering such calls, maybe i should say a run for my money. yes, i’m aware that melania trump is from slovenia, and i want to make it clear that i’m not in any way casting blame on her. she has enough on her plate as it is.
